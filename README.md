# SpotifyArtistLocations

## Synopsis

Using this project, it is possible to get locations from a spotify playlist using the spotify API. The program will then try to find the origin locations for these artists by searching on multiple sites.

## Usage

In order to use the spotify API, you need to use a spotify account to log in to the [Spotify developer dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications "Spotify developer dashboard"), create an application and generate a cliend ID and client Secret. In SpotifyArtistLocations/Data/Credentials.cs, {SPOTIFY CLIENT ID} and {SPOTIFY CLIENT SECRET} has to be replaced with these values.
